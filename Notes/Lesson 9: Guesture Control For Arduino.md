# Lesson 9: Guesture Control For Arduino

### üß† **Original Code Recap**
In the original code, you used **MediaPipe** to detect hands and count how many fingers are up using `get_finger_states()`. You displayed the result (`finger_states`) visually on the screen using OpenCV, but **you didn't connect this detection to any physical hardware**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **What We Learned in Lesson 8**
In **Lesson 8**, you learned how to:
- **Send data from Python to an Arduino** using **serial communication**.
- Use the `pyserial` library to open a communication channel with the Arduino.
- Send specific **bytes** that the Arduino can understand and respond to.

---

### ‚ûï **What's Added in the Modified Code**

#### ‚úÖ 1. **Serial Connection Setup**
```python
arduino = serial.Serial(port='/dev/cu.usbserial-1140', baudrate=9600, timeout=1)
time.sleep(2)  # Give Arduino time to reset
```
- This line opens a **serial connection** to the Arduino through the USB port (`/dev/cu.usbserial-1140`).
- The `baudrate=9600` must match the baud rate in your Arduino sketch.
- `time.sleep(2)` gives the Arduino enough time to reset after the connection is established. This is important, or the Arduino might miss the first few commands.

#### ‚úÖ 2. **Sending Gestures to Arduino**
```python
arduino.write(b'0')  # example inside detect_gesture()
```
- In the `detect_gesture()` function, you added `arduino.write(b'X')` commands.
- This sends a **byte** (`b'0'`, `b'1'`, ..., `b'5'`) to the Arduino whenever a specific finger gesture is detected.
- These bytes act like **commands** that your Arduino can decode and respond to‚Äîlike turning on LEDs, playing buzzers, moving servos, etc.

### üß© **Putting It All Together**
So now, instead of just *seeing* the detected gesture on screen, you're using what you learned from **Lesson 8** to:
- **Send commands** to your Arduino
- **Physically control devices** based on your hand gestures

### üìü Now we move on to the **Arduino side of the project**

Your Python‚ÄìOpenCV script sends gesture data (`'0'` to `'5'`) through **serial communication**. The Arduino listens for that data and reacts to it.

Let‚Äôs break down what‚Äôs happening:

---

### üõë **Why not use pin 1?**
Pin **1** on the Arduino (along with pin 0) is used for **Serial communication** (`TX/RX`).  
- If you use pin 1 as a regular output while also using `Serial.begin()`, you can cause **conflicts or unexpected behavior**.
- That‚Äôs why your LEDs or outputs start from **pin 2** and go to pin 6 instead.

---

### üì• `Serial.read();`
```cpp
char gesture = Serial.read();
```
- This reads **one character** that was sent over the serial connection (e.g., `'3'` from Python).
- It‚Äôs stored in the variable `gesture`, which you then use to decide what to do next.

---

### üîÄ The `if` statements
```cpp
if (gesture == '0') {
  control(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
}
...
```
- Each `if` checks which gesture was received.
- Based on the gesture (e.g., `'1'`, `'2'`, etc.), it calls the `control()` function with different values.
- These values represent the brightness (0‚Äì255) of each LED (or output pin).

So for example:
- `'1'` ‚Üí Only the first LED (pin 2) turns on at full brightness.
- `'3'` ‚Üí Pins 2, 3, and 4 are turned on.
- `'5'` ‚Üí All five pins (2‚Äì6) are on.

---

### üß† `control()` function
```cpp
void control(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e) {
  analogWrite(2, a);
  analogWrite(3, b);
  analogWrite(4, c);
  analogWrite(5, d);
  analogWrite(6, e);
}
```
- This function receives five values and writes them to pins 2 through 6 using `analogWrite`.
- `analogWrite(pin, value)` controls the **PWM signal**, letting you dim LEDs or control motor speeds.
- By using this function, your code stays **clean and organized** instead of repeating the same `analogWrite()` lines over and over.

[L9_gesture_control_for_arduino.ino](../arduino/sketches/L9_gesture_control_for_arduino/L9_gesture_control_for_arduino.ino)

```cpp
void setup() {
  // Initialize pins 2 to 6 as OUTPUT
  for (int i = 2; i <= 6; i++) {
    pinMode(i, OUTPUT);
  }

  Serial.begin(9600);  // Start the serial communication
}

void loop() {
  if (Serial.available() > 0) {
    char gesture = Serial.read();

    if (gesture == '0') {
      control(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    } else if (gesture == '1') {
      control(255, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    } else if (gesture == '2') {
      control(255, 255, 0, 0, 0);
    } else if (gesture == '3') {
      control(255, 255, 255, 0, 0);
    } else if (gesture == '4') {
      control(255, 255, 255, 255, 0);
    } else if (gesture == '5') {
      control(255, 255, 255, 255, 255);
    } else {
      control(0, 0, 0, 0, 0); // default
    }
  }
}

void control(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e) {
  analogWrite(2, a);
  analogWrite(3, b);
  analogWrite(4, c);
  analogWrite(5, d);
  analogWrite(6, e);
}
