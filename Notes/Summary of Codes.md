### Lesson 1: Arduino Serial Communication

- **Serial.begin(9600)**: Starts a "talking line" between your Arduino and computer.
- **Serial.read()**: Reads one character from the "talking line" (like grabbing a letter from the inbox).
- **Serial.write()**: Sends a letter back to the computer (writing something to the talking line).
- **Serial.available() > 0**: Checks if thereâ€™s a letter in the inbox waiting to be read.
